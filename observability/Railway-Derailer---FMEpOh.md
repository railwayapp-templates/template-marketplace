## About

![Github Repository Header](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0af361a4-2a0a-4362-800b-36d19299ee9d)

Derailer is a tool that helps test for how services handle random dependency failures,
on [Railway](https://railway.com). Inspired by [Netflix's Chaos Monkey](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey).
Derailer randomly removes instances of running services. Allowing you to build more
resilient services by finding missed opportunities to handle failures gracefully.

**[CAUTION]
You should avoid deploying this onto your customer facing environment, as it may have visible impact, we suggest sticking to staging!**

**If you've read the above disclaimer and understand it, click to deploy**

## ▶️ Derailment Process

Every so often (defined in `FREQUENCY_CRON`), the Derailer lists your Railway services and filters them to ones that
aren't in the configured blacklist.

Using this list, it chooses to 'Derail' a number of your services (using `BLAST_RADIUS`), this is done by **Aborting
Deployments**, it will remove the currently active deployment of your service.

After the defined `DURATION_MINUTES`, it will re-deploy any effected services.

**The derailed services are stored in a persistent volume (on MongoDB), meaning re-deploying this service will restore
any effected services when it comes online!**

## 👀 User Interface

![User Interface](https://i.imgur.com/FCGXeKZ.png)

**[WARNING]
This user interface is not password protected, we suggest using [a cloudflare tunnel](https://railway.com/template/cf-tunnel), or implementing your own authentication in a forked version.**

Derailer comes with a (very primitive) user interface for controlling how the derailer behaves.

**Features:**
- Viewing an active derailment and what services it's impacting
- Rollback an active derailment if it's causing a headache
- Viewing when the next derailment will occur
- Viewing a history of which services were impacted for each past derailment
- Pausing derailments for a certain time period (to allow for some rest!)

## 🤖 Rest API
**[WARNING]
This API is not password protected, we suggest using [a cloudflare tunnel](https://railway.com/template/cf-tunnel), or implementing your own authentication in a forked version.**

For ease of use, all the features mentioned in our user interface are supported within a REST API, check out the [API
documentation](https://github.com/PostSuite/railway-derailer/blob/dev/docs/openapi/openapi.json).

## 🧩 Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

| Variable 	       | Description 	                                                                           | Default Value 	 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| RAILWAY_API_KEY  | Your Railway API key, required to list your services and fetch your running deployments |                 |
| FREQUENCY_CRON   | A chron expression defining how often to run the derailer                               | 0 0 * * * ?     |
| DURATION_MINUTES | How long (in minutes) to keep deployments aborted	                                      | 60              |
| BLAST_RADIUS     | How many services to impact in each run of the Derailer                                 | 2               |

### Blacklisting services

By default, the only service automatically blacklisted is the Derailer application. However, you may want to blacklist
some UIs, monitoring systems, or essential services (think carefully about how reliable they are!) to avoid everything
falling on its face.

This can be configured in `src/main/resources/application.properties` (`derailment.blacklist`)
