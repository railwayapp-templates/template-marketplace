# Deploy Firecrawl on Railway

Web scraping and crawling API with authentication and persistent queues.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/firecrawl-1)

## About

Deploy a private Firecrawl API/worker harness behind an API-key gateway, with a browser renderer, PostgreSQL-backed NuQ queue, Redis, and RabbitMQ. Images are pinned by digest; the API image identifies source commit `2343d7b7b93cf4653b80e0c2b8cb681ba2661803`.

This six-service deployment puts a small API-key gateway in front of Firecrawl, its browser renderer, and the queue infrastructure. Railway exposes only the gateway over HTTPS; the API harness, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and renderer communicate privately. The API and browser images are pinned by digest, while the gateway is built from the included Dockerfile. Queue data is stored on persistent volumes. A generated operator key authenticates client requests without requiring a separate authentication database. Concurrency starts conservatively at two. After deployment, retrieve the key from the gateway variables and point your SDK or HTTP client at the gateway domain.

| --------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `ENV` | api | local | Firecrawl runtime mode. Keep local for this self-hosted deployment. |
| `HOST` | api | 0.0.0.0 | HTTP bind address. Keep 0.0.0.0 so Railway can reach the service. |
| `PORT` | api | 3002 | HTTP port inside this service. Keep the default to match its Railway public port and health check. |
| `REDIS_URL` | api | - | Private authenticated Redis/Valkey connection URL. Automatically assembled from service references. |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | api | postgres | Initial PostgreSQL database name, or the matching database selected by the application. |
| `WORKER_PORT` | api | 3005 | Internal Firecrawl worker HTTP port. Keep the supplied port and do not expose it publicly. |
| `BULL_AUTH_KEY` | api | (secret) | Generated secret protecting Firecrawl queue administration. Keep private. |
